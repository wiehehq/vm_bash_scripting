COMMENT: As of now, you must run the following commands in your Ubuntu 18.04 Desktop environment yourself. No other environments are technically supported, but hopefully you can figure them our yourself. Feel free to change what you feel comfortable with at your own discretion. If anything looks amiss, refer back to these commands to review issues.


$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "local_vm_generic_default_user_email.com" -f "/home/dev/.ssh/id_rsa"
$ eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
$ sudo apt install git-all
$ git clone git@github.com:wiehehq/vm_bash_scripting.git
$ cd vm_bash_scripting
$ git config --global user.email "local_vm_generic_default_user_email.com"
$ git config --global user.name "local_vm_generic_default_user_name"
$ git pull origin master
